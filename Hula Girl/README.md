# Hula Girl

A simple proof-of-concept to loop PNGs and create basic animation.

The images have been taken from a Yahoo Widget of the same name.

The script uses GDI+ to create a GUI from an image and then continuously changes it.

You can run multiple instances, drag the GUI to reposition, Right Click on the GUI to play/pause animation.

Press Esc to exit.
