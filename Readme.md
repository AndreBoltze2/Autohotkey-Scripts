# Autohotkey Scripts

These are some of my [Autohotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) scripts for windows.

All of these have been tested on Windows XP, some have also been checked on Windows 7.

Each project contains a separate Readme, which goes further into the detail.

I advise that you [download the stdlib](/lib) and copy it to your AHK Install directory.
