# AHK Standard Library

This is the standard library by [tuncay](http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/50834-ahk-standard-library-collection-2010-sep-gui-libs-100), kept here just as a backup.

To use these functions, just download the lib folder and put in your AHK Install directory, typically, C:\Program Files\Autohotkey\
